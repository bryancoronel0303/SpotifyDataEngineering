# SpotifyDataEngineering
Implementing common data processing practices on my own listening history!

MOTIVATIONS:
I've always been passionate about listening and discovering new music. Back in high school, I was inspired by Anthony Fantano to start reviewing my favorite music on YouTube. I stopped that hobby a few years ago, but ever since then I've been experimenting with blending the technicals skills I learn inside the classroom with the passions I pursue outside of it!!!
